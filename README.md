# T.S.U.N.A.M.I. Vehicles

T.S.U.N.A.M.I. stands for Top Secret Unmanned Application of Mobile Intelligence. These vehicles can range from 50-5000$ and their main computers are usually Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA's Jetson Series. 

## Power Management System
In order to power these vehicles, we decided to build a custom power banks for different levels(Marks) that fulfills the the power requirements of different robots. 

#### TSUNAMI PMS MK1
This PMS was designed to power mobile robots that require 5V(<4A) for their computers and 5-35V(<4A) for their motor drive system. This PMS feeds on 5V micro USB and can be used while charging.

SPECS:
* 2 Sony 18650VTC6 3000mAh Li-Ion Battery  
* Overcharge, Over-discharge, Over-current protection.  
* 2 adjustable voltage outputs  
* Charge while Use

#### TSUNAMI PMS MK2
This PMS was designed to power mobile robots that require 12V for their computers and for their motor drive system. The maximum continous amperage supplied is 80A and can burst 120A for a short amount of time. 

SPECS:
* 12 Sony 18650VTC6 3000mAh Li-Ion Battery  
* Overcharge, Over-discharge, Over-current protection.  
* MAX 80-120A Output at 12V  
* Charge while Use
